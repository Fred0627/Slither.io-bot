# God Mode Assist - ENHANCED BOOST VERSION 

## 🚀 **MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED**

### ✅ **Boost-Aware Detection**
- **Base radius**: 80px
- **Boosting**: 280px (3.5x multiplier)
- **Dual boost**: 560px (7x multiplier when both snakes boost)
- **Dynamic scaling**: Detection radius shown in debug

### ✅ **Smart Boost Management**
- **Tracks boost state**: Knows if you were boosting before takeover
- **Intelligent interruption**: Stops boost for sharp turns (80%+ threat)
- **Automatic resumption**: Restarts boost when safe
- **Maintains boost**: Keeps boost for medium threats (escape faster)

### ✅ **Aggressive Survival Turning**
- **90° approach**: 126° turn (almost U-turn)
- **45° approach**: 99° turn (sharp redirect) 
- **10° approach**: 72° turn (get parallel fast)
- **Boost physics**: 40% turning vs 80% normal (realistic limitations)
- **Emergency mode**: +20% more aggressive when 70%+ threat

### ✅ **Enhanced Debug Information**
- **Boost state**: Shows ON/OFF and current detection radius
- **Threat analysis**: Time to collision in frames
- **Collision points**: Visual dots on detected threats
- **Console logging**: Detailed takeover reasoning

## 🎯 **New Behaviors:**

### **Boost Detection Scenarios:**
```javascript
Normal speed:     80px detection radius
You boosting:     280px detection radius  
Enemy boosting:   280px detection radius
Both boosting:    560px detection radius
```

### **Smart Boost Logic:**
```javascript
High threat (80%+):  Stop boost → sharp turn → resume if player was boosting
Med threat (60%+):   Activate boost → escape faster  
Low threat (<60%):   Maintain player's boost state
```

### **Aggressive Turning:**
```javascript
Head-on collision:   126° turn (almost reverse direction)
Angled approach:     99° turn (sharp redirect to parallel)
Shallow approach:    72° turn (strong correction)
```

## 🧪 **Testing Focus:**

### **1. Boost Detection Test:**
- Boost and approach snake - should see detection radius increase to 280px
- Both boost - should see detection radius increase to 560px
- Debug shows: "Boost: ON | Detection: 280px"

### **2. Boost Management Test:**
- Boost toward collision at 90° - should stop boost, turn sharp, resume boost
- Console: "🛑 BOOST STOPPED for sharp turn" → "✅ GOD MODE RELEASED - Boost resumed"

### **3. Aggressive Turning Test:**
- Rush head-on into snake - should do almost U-turn (126°)
- Should end up running parallel to obstacle, not just slightly avoiding

### **4. Emergency vs Escape Test:**
- Very close collision (80%+ threat) - stops boost for maximum turn
- Medium threat (60%+ threat) - maintains/starts boost to escape faster

## 🎮 **Visual Indicators:**

### **Debug Panel (Press X):**
- **"GOD MODE: ON/OFF"** - System status
- **"Boost: ON/OFF | Detection: XXXpx"** - Current boost and radius
- **"Monitoring..." / "EMERGENCY ACTIVE!"** - Current state
- **"Nearby Snakes: X"** - Count within detection radius
- **"Threats: X"** - Actual collision threats detected
- **"Max Threat: X%"** - Highest threat level
- **"Time to Collision: X.Xf"** - Frames until impact
- **"Collision Points: X"** - Total detection points

### **Visual Elements:**
- **Yellow circle**: Current detection radius (grows with boost)
- **Red circle**: Emergency radius (40px)
- **Cyan line**: Your trajectory
- **Red dots**: Snake heads detected
- **Orange dots**: Snake body segments detected

## 📝 **Console Messages:**

### **Takeover Messages:**
```
🚨 GOD MODE TAKEOVER! Threat: 85%, Time: 23.4 frames, Boost: true
🛑 BOOST STOPPED for sharp turn
⚡ BOOST ACTIVATED for escape  
⚡ BOOST MAINTAINED
✅ GOD MODE RELEASED - Boost resumed
✅ GOD MODE RELEASED - Control returned to player
```

## 🔧 **Tunable Constants:**

### **Detection (adjust if too sensitive/not sensitive enough):**
```javascript
baseDangerRadius: 80,        // Base detection distance
boostMultiplier: 3.5,        // Boost detection multiplier  
dualBoostMultiplier: 7.0,    // Both boosting multiplier
maxThreatLevel: 0.3,         // Activation threshold (30%)
```

### **Turning (adjust for more/less aggressive turns):**
```javascript
boostTurnMultiplier: 0.4,    // Turn ability when boosting (40%)
normalTurnMultiplier: 0.8,   // Turn ability normal speed (80%)
speedBoostThreshold: 0.6,    // When to boost for escape (60%)
```

## 🎯 **Expected "Magnet Effect":**

With these settings, the system should feel much more like a **repulsive magnet**:

1. **Early detection** with boost-aware radius expansion
2. **Aggressive turning** that ensures you end up parallel to obstacles  
3. **Smart boost management** that optimizes survival vs escape speed
4. **Shorter cooldowns** for faster response to multiple threats

**You should now find it much harder to die, even when trying to!** 🧲

## 📊 **Build Info:**
- **Lines**: 2,318 (was 2,267)
- **Size**: 78KB (was 76KB) 
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for enhanced testing

**This version should provide the "magnetic repulsion" feeling you're looking for with much smarter boost physics!** 🚀
