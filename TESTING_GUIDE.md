# God Mode Assist - Testing Guide

## 🚨 UPDATED BUILD - Key Issues Fixed

### ❌ Previous Issues:
1. Visuals only worked when bot was enabled 
2. Threat detection was too conservative
3. No clear feedback when system was working

### ✅ Fixed in This Version:
1. **Independent Visual Rendering** - Visuals work whether bot is enabled or disabled
2. **More Sensitive Detection** - Increased danger radius from 60 to 120 pixels
3. **Better Debugging** - Added detailed status display and console logging
4. **Lower Activation Threshold** - Reduced from 60% to 30% threat level

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Install & Enable
1. Install the updated `userscript/bot.user.js` in Tampermonkey
2. Go to slither.io
3. **Press G** to enable God Mode Assist
   - You should see console message: "God Mode Assist: ENABLED"
4. **Press X** to enable visuals
   - You should see console message: "God Mode Visuals: ENABLED"

### Step 2: Visual Verification
**You should immediately see:**
- ✅ **"GOD MODE: ON"** text in green at top-left
- ✅ **Yellow circle** around your snake (danger radius - 120px)
- ✅ **Red circle** around your snake (emergency radius - 70px)  
- ✅ **Debug info** showing:
  - Current state: "Monitoring..."
  - Nearby Snakes: [number]
  - Threats: [number]

### Step 3: Behavior Testing
**To test collision avoidance:**
1. Move toward another snake deliberately
2. When you get within ~120 pixels, you should see:
   - ✅ **"Threats: 1"** (or more) 
   - ✅ **Threat level percentage** appears
3. When you get closer (~70 pixels), you should see:
   - ✅ **"EMERGENCY ACTIVE!"** in red
   - ✅ **Snake control taken over** (mouse ignored temporarily)
   - ✅ **Speed boost** (if very close)

## 🔍 Debugging

### If Visuals Don't Appear:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify both G and X keys were pressed
3. Make sure you're in an active game (not menu)

### If No Collision Avoidance:
1. Check if "Nearby Snakes" count increases when near others
2. Try getting very close to another snake (within 70 pixels)
3. Look for "Threats" count to increase

### Console Commands for Testing:
Open browser console (F12) and try:
```javascript
// Check god mode status
bot.getGodModeStats()

// Force enable god mode
bot.godModeEnabled(true)
bot.godModeVisualsEnabled(true)
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Normal Play:
- Visuals show monitoring state
- No interference with your controls
- Debug info updates in real-time

### Near Another Snake:
- Threat counter increases
- Threat level percentage appears
- Yellow circle may change to red

### Emergency Situation:
- "EMERGENCY ACTIVE!" message
- Control temporarily taken
- Snake moves to safe direction automatically
- Speed boost if very close collision

## 📝 Feedback Needed

Please test and report:
1. ✅/❌ Do you see the visual indicators?
2. ✅/❌ Does the system detect nearby snakes?
3. ✅/❌ Does it take control in emergency situations?
4. ✅/❌ Does it feel natural when it intervenes?
5. 🔧 Any suggestions for threshold adjustments?

The thresholds are intentionally sensitive for testing - they can be fine-tuned based on your feedback!
