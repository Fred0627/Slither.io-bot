# Slither.io Bot Championship Edition

## Introduction

The Championship Edition bot was an excellent bot script that keeps circling and growing (known as kiosking), but in 2018 it became a public archive and was no longer maintained.
Eventually, the official game code was updated and this script no longer works.

This repository is based on the Championship Edition code and adapted to the new game code.
