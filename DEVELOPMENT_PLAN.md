# Slither.io God Mode Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the incremental development plan for enhancing the slither.io bot with god mode capabilities, progressing from basic collision avoidance to advanced AI-driven gameplay.

## Phase 1: Enhanced Collision Prediction System âœ… COMPLETED

### Features Implemented:
- **Predictive Trajectory Analysis**: Predicts enemy snake movements up to 30 frames ahead
- **Emergency Avoidance System**: Automatically overrides normal bot behavior when immediate collision threats are detected
- **Threat Level Assessment**: Analyzes multiple threats simultaneously and prioritizes the most dangerous ones
- **God Mode Toggle**: Press 'U' key to enable/disable god mode

### Technical Implementation:
- `GodMode` class with trajectory prediction algorithms
- Integration with existing `Bot` class
- Emergency avoidance that overrides normal bot behavior
- Visual indicators for threats and emergency states

### Key Benefits:
- Significantly improved survival rate in high-traffic areas
- Proactive rather than reactive collision avoidance
- Maintains compatibility with existing bot features

## Phase 2: Advanced Trajectory Prediction (Next Phase)

### Planned Features:
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Replace simple linear prediction with behavior pattern recognition
- **Player Behavior Analysis**: Detect and categorize different player types (aggressive, defensive, erratic)
- **Speed/Direction Change Prediction**: Anticipate acceleration and direction changes
- **Multi-Step Lookahead**: Extend prediction to 60+ frames with dynamic accuracy adjustment

### Technical Goals:
- Implement basic neural network for behavior prediction
- Add snake movement pattern recognition
- Create behavior classification system
- Optimize prediction accuracy vs. performance

### Expected Improvements:
- 40% better collision prediction accuracy
- Reduced false positives in threat detection
- Better handling of unpredictable players

## Phase 3: Sophisticated Kill Opportunity Detection

### Planned Features:
- **Intercept Trajectory Calculation**: Calculate optimal paths to cut off enemy snakes
- **Size/Speed Advantage Analysis**: Only target snakes with favorable odds
- **Multi-Snake Coordination**: Plan kills that avoid creating new threats
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate kill attempts vs. survival probability

### Technical Implementation:
- Advanced geometric algorithms for intercept calculations
- Probability matrices for kill success rates
- Dynamic risk/reward evaluation
- Integration with emergency avoidance system

### Expected Capabilities:
- Automatic identification of kill opportunities
- Smart target selection based on multiple factors
- Balanced aggressive/defensive gameplay

## Installation and Usage

### Current Version (Phase 1):
1. Install Tampermonkey extension in your browser
2. Install the compiled script from `userscript/bot.user.js`
3. Go to slither.io
4. Press 'T' to enable the bot
5. Press 'U' to enable God Mode
6. Press 'Y' for visual debugging

### God Mode Controls:
- **U**: Toggle God Mode on/off
- **T**: Toggle bot on/off
- **Y**: Toggle visual debugging
- **Right Click**: Toggle bot (alternative)

### Visual Indicators:
- **Red Circle + Red Line**: Emergency avoidance active
- **Orange Circle**: Threat detected
- **Green Line**: Normal bot navigation
- **Red Dot**: Target destination

## Configuration Options

### God Mode Settings (in `src/bot/god-mode.ts`):
```typescript
opt = {
    predictionFrames: 30,        // How far ahead to predict (frames)
    minThreatDistance: 100,      // Minimum distance to consider a threat
    emergencyCooldown: 60,       // Frames between emergency actions
    maxThreatLevel: 0.8,         // Threat level that triggers emergency
    trajectorySteps: 5,          // Trajectory calculation precision
    killOpportunityThreshold: 0.7 // Minimum kill success probability
}
```
